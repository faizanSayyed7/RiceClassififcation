# üåæ Rice Type Classification üçö

Welcome to the **Rice Type Classification** project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a classification model to distinguish between different types of rice grains.

## üîç Overview

This project leverages a machine learning approach to classify rice based on various morphological features. We utilize a neural network built with PyTorch to achieve high accuracy in this classification task.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the "Rice Type Classification" dataset, which is available on Kaggle.

* **Dataset Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mssmartypants/rice-type-classification)
* **Filename:** `riceClassification.csv`
* **Features:** The dataset includes 11 features such as `Area`, `MajorAxisLength`, `MinorAxisLength`, `Eccentricity`, `ConvexArea`, `EquivDiameter`, `Extent`, `Perimeter`, `Roundness`, and `AspectRation`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Implementation

The notebook follows a clear workflow for data preparation and model training:

1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded using pandas. The 'id' column is dropped, and the features are normalized.
2.  **PyTorch Implementation:** A simple neural network is defined using PyTorch's `nn.Module`.
3.  **Training:** The model is trained using the `BCELoss` criterion and the `Adam` optimizer. Training and validation loss and accuracy are tracked across 10 epochs.

## ‚ú® Key Results

The model demonstrates excellent performance on the classification task.

* **Final Test Accuracy:** 98.68%

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (PyTorch, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) installed.
3.  Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.
4.  Open and run `notebook85daaf6a3b.ipynb`.

We hope this project helps you explore the world of rice classification! üçö‚ú®
